# First Person - RigidDynamicBody3D
Hello, this is a simple First Person template using RigidDynamicBody3D that I made for personal, feel free to use.

## Info

 - Requires Godot 4.0 (Alpha 10)
 - Uses RigidDynamicBody3D over CharacterBody3D to interact better with other physics bodies.
 - MIT License
 - Maybe one day I will place comments over the code ðŸ˜‹
